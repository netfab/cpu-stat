# cpu-stat
A command line program to get CPU usage statistics on Linux systems.

![cpu-stat](https://github.com/vivaladav/cpu-stat/blob/master/data/imgs/CPU-STAT-logo-256.png?raw=true)

I created cpu-stat to have a quick and simple answer to the question "what's the CPU usage of my system right now?" and that's what you get when you run the program with no options.

The intended use is for scripts or system monitoring tools which do not want to parse */proc/stat* directly to get CPU usage stats.

For people interested in understanding more about how things work under the hood, I wrote a [tutorial](http://blog.davidecoppola.com/2016/12/cpp-program-to-get-cpu-usage-from-command-line-in-linux/) describing a much simpler version of this program and providing more information on the different CPU states.

NOTE: cpu-stat requires Linux kernel 2.6.33 or newer.

## Development
To build cpu-stat you need [CMake](https://cmake.org/) or any IDE that can handle CMake files.

**simple build**

This will build cpu-stat in debug mode:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make

**build in release mode**

This will build cpu-stat in release mode:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
    $ make

**install release build**

This will install cpu-stat in */usr/local/bin/* after a build is completed.

    $ cd build
    $ make install

**clean release build**

This will remove all files generated by a build:

    $ cd build
    $ make clean

## Usage

**Print options**

| flag | description | default |
| ---- | ------------| ------- |
| -a \| --all | print active time percentage for all CPUs, starting with total | false |
| -c \<cpu\> | print stats only for selected CPU. | - |
| -f \| --full-state | print time percentage of all states | false |
| -p \<precision\> | set the decimal precision of printed numbers  | 2 |
|  -s \<state\> |  print time percentage for specific state [0-9]  | - |
| -v \| --verbose | enable verbose mode | false |

**Other options**

| flag | description | default |
| ---- | ------------| ------- |
| -d \<time\> | set delay time (in ms) between 2 snapshots of CPU data  | 100 |
| -h \| --help  | print help  | - |
| --version |  print the version number  | - |

## Examples

Print percentage of active time for total CPU:
```
$ cpu-stat
2.50
```

Print percentage of active time for all CPUs in verbose mode (with labels):
```
$ cpu-stat -a -v
tot] 5.00%
  0] 0.00%
  1] 0.00%
  2] 20.00%
  3] 0.00%
```

Print percentage of idle time (state 3) for CPU 2 using 4 digits as decimal precision:
```
$ cpu-stat -s 3 -c 2 -p 4
100.0000
```

Print percentage of all states for all CPUs in verbose mode (with labels):
```
$ cpu-stat -a -v -f
tot] usr:   0.00% | sys:   0.00% | nic:   0.00% | idl: 100.00% | iow:   0.00% | hir:   0.00% | sir:   0.00% | ste:   0.00% | gue:   0.00% | gun:   0.00% | 
  0] usr:   0.00% | sys:   0.00% | nic:   0.00% | idl: 100.00% | iow:   0.00% | hir:   0.00% | sir:   0.00% | ste:   0.00% | gue:   0.00% | gun:   0.00% | 
  1] usr:   0.00% | sys:   0.00% | nic:   0.00% | idl: 100.00% | iow:   0.00% | hir:   0.00% | sir:   0.00% | ste:   0.00% | gue:   0.00% | gun:   0.00% | 
  2] usr:   0.00% | sys:   0.00% | nic:   0.00% | idl: 100.00% | iow:   0.00% | hir:   0.00% | sir:   0.00% | ste:   0.00% | gue:   0.00% | gun:   0.00% | 
  3] usr:   0.00% | sys:   0.00% | nic:   0.00% | idl:  90.91% | iow:   9.09% | hir:   0.00% | sir:   0.00% | ste:   0.00% | gue:   0.00% | gun:   0.00% |
